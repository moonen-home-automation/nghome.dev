# Learning

> *The ability to recognize patterns*

Learning in a smart home system involves the continuous collection and analysis
of data to identify patterns, adapt to user preferences, predict future needs, 
and improve the overall efficiency and functionality of the home. This learning
process enables the system to provide a more personalized, comfortable,
and responsive living environment.

### Pattern recognition

The system analyzes the collected data to identify trends and patterns.
It might recognize that the occupants typically lower the thermostat in
the evening and raise it in the morning.
It can also detect regularities in daily routines, such as the times when
occupants are usually home, their preferred lighting settings,
and their usual sleep and wake times.
It can learn and store these patterns for optimizing and building automations.
Also, personal profiles can be created for different occupants,
tailored settings, and responses to individual preferences. It might
recognize different users based on behavior and adjust that person's profile to their likes and habits.
It also takes into account context, like time of day or indoor temperature.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

The system might use supervised learning algorithms where it is trained
with labeled data. It could be taught that certain patterns of movement
detected by sensors correspond to the presence of different family members.
The system continually refines its algorithms and models based on
new data and feedback. If an occupant manually adjusts
the temperature frequently, the system learns and adjusts its automated
settings to reduce the need for manual intervention.

The system can also use unsupervised learning to find hidden patterns or anomalies in the
data without pre-labeled outcomes. It might cluster different
usage patterns of devices to optimize energy consumption.
The system learns from errors or user corrections, improving its accuracy
and reliability over time. If a user consistently overrides
the system's automatic actions, it adjusts its future behavior to align
better with the user's preferences.
