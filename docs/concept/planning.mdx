# Planning

> *The ability to predictively schedule*

Planning is the process of anticipating future needs and events and taking actions
in advance to meet those needs. Like creating schedules and preparing
for different scenarios based on the learned knowledge.

### Anticipating needs

Using analyzed data and learned patterns to predict future requirements, such as
when the heating should be turned on or when appliances should be used.
For example, if the system
detects that a user's current location is at a grocery store, it might
infer that the occupant is doing errands and bringing home large and heavy items.
It will plan their arrival by opening the door and turning on the lights.
An integration with the occupants their personal calendars can give the system more
insights into events that are about to happen, helping it anticipate better.

### Scheduling

Creating schedules based on anticipated needs, daily routines, and specific events.
Like setting the lighting scene during dinner time. Creating different schedules for
different events like parties or family gatherings.
The system also optimizes the use of resources such as energy and water by scheduling
their use in the most efficient ways. It might schedule energy-intensive tasks like running
the dishwasher during off-peak hours when energy is less expensive.
The system has the ability to schedule preventive actions to avoid potential problems, such as running a
health check on critical appliances and notifying about maintenance before issues arise.
Also preparing for different scenarios by simulating potential events and developing appropriate responses.
This could be in the form of a plan for a potential power outage that ensures essential systems remain operational.
These plans can be executed on-demand or scheduled when issues are anticipated.
