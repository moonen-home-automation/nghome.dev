# Perception

> *The ability to sense an environment*

Perception in a smart home system involves the ability to sense various aspects of
the environment through multiple inputs, process, and interpret this data to understand
the current state of the home. This layer is foundational for the smart home, without any of this input data, it will not be able
to make decisions, execute actions, and learn from its environment.

### Sensors and inputs

A home needs to be equipped with a variety of sensors that collect data
from the physical environment. These can include:

* **Motion sensors:** To detect movement within a space.
* **Temperature sensors:** To measure ambient temperature.
* **Light sensors:** To monitor light levels in different areas.
* **Humidity sensors:** To gauge moisture levels in the air.
* **Sound sensors:** To pick up sound levels, including specific noises like alarms or breaking glass.
* **Cameras:** To provide visual data and can be used for facial recognition and security monitoring.
* **Gas and smoke detectors:** To identify potentially hazardous conditions like gas leaks or smoke from a fire.

You can compare these sensors with your human senses. If someone took away your smell and sight, you will be
far less capable of scouting your environment; the same goes for a smart home system. The more sensors and
data there is to collect, the better its understanding of the environment will be.

### Data collection

The system continuously collects data from these sensors
to maintain an up-to-date understanding of the home environment.
This data helps to create a detailed map of the home's conditions,
such as room occupancy, temperature zones, and light levels.
This data needs to be stored in a clear and concise way to make
it available for the system's other components.

### Interpretation and processing

Raw sensor data is processed to extract meaningful information. 
Meaning, a motion sensor might send data indicating movement,
which is then interpreted as someone entering or leaving a room.
This way, data extracted from the sensors becomes understandable
to both the user and other parts of the smart home system.
The system also uses contextual information to interpret sensor data accurately.
For instance, a temperature rise detected by a sensor could mean different
things depending on whether it's caused by the heating system being on or
direct sunlight entering through a window.
Information from different sensors is integrated to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the environment. A good example of this is combining
data from motion sensors and cameras to enhance security monitoring
by verifying whether detected movement is caused by a person or an object like a pet.
