# Adaptation

> *The ability to dynamically adjust in real-time*

Although very similar to [Learning](./learning.mdx) and [Planning](./planning.mdx), there is a clear distinction.
Where **Learning** is the process of acquiring and understanding information over time.
And **Planning** is the process of anticipating future needs and events and taking actions in advance to meet those needs.
**Adaptation** is the application of the learned knowledge to make dynamic,
real-time adjustments to the system's behavior. It involves responding to the current context
and conditions to optimize performance and user experience.

### Real-time adjustments

Modify actions and responses dynamically based on the current situation. For example,
adjusting the lighting and temperature when the system detects that the occupants
have arrived home earlier than expected. Making decisions that are appropriate for
the specific context and moment. Like adjusting the thermostat based on real-time weather data.
Or closing the blinds when there is an excess amount of light coming in.
The system is able to adjust itself through multi-step solutions to solve complex
problems. If it detects that no one is home and the outside temperature is dropping, it might close the windows,
adjust the heating, and switch to an energy-saving mode.

Responding to context in real-time can be important for security scenarios. It might recognize
unusual activity patterns that could indicate a break-in and trigger an alarm.
In case of emergencies like a fire or gas leak, the system adjusts itself and calculates the best
course of action, such as sounding alarms, unlocking doors for easy exit, and notifying emergency services.

### Behavioral changes

Changing operational strategies based on feedback and changing conditions. Adapting the default
behavior of the lighting system based on user preferences and overrides.
Like stopping automatic scheduled lights when the system detects that a user has manually overrode
the light levels.
Using feedback loops to refine and improve future responses, ensuring the system
remains responsive to changing conditions and preferences.
The system can calculate the trade-offs between comfort and efficiency,
adapting itself to the current conditions in its environment. An example of this would be
pausing the washing machine when the energy prices are becoming very high.
