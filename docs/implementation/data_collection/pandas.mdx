In the topic about [TimescaleDB](./timescale.mdx) you can see how data can be shipped from Home Assistant to an external database.
Now this raw data is of little use for us we want to use it for analytics and machine learning.
Luckily we can easily manipulate and parse this data using Python and an amazing library called Pandas.

## Pandas

Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analytics and machine learning tasks.
Pandas makes it simple to do many of the time consuming, repetitive tasks associated with working with data, including:

* Data cleansing
* Data fill
* Data normalization
* Merging and joining data
* Data visualizations
* Statistical analysis
* Data inspection
* Loading and saving data
* And much more

Pandas can retrieve data and format it as a table, these tables are called DataFrames.
These DataFrames consist of rows and columns just like your used to with tables.

## Lab - Working with Pandas

I created a lab exercise that you can you do for free on Google Colab. Check it out [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/moonen-home-automation/colab-notebooks/blob/main/pandas-example/pandas-example.ipynb)

This will show you an use case of manipulating data coming from Home Assistant sensor and making it suitable for training a ML model.
