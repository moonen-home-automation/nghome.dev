Data is everywhere in the smart home. From things like sensors to smart appliances, everything generates data.
This data needs to be collected and stored efficiently.
We need all this data if we want to build future automation and machine learning models.

TimescaleDB allows us to easily collect, manage, and export our data. TimescaleDB is built on top of PostgreSQL,
giving us the ability to easily access the collected data through pgAdmin or with SQL queries.
Let's dive into what this technology is and how we can implement it in Home Assistant.

## Overview

### PostgreSQL

[Source](https://www.postgresql.org/about/)

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language
combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
PostgreSQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set,
extensibility, and the dedication of the open source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant
and innovative solutions.

### TimescaleDB

[Source](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/introduction)

TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database optimized for fast ingest and complex queries. It speaks "full SQL"
and is correspondingly easy to use like a traditional relation database, yet scales in ways previously reserved for NoSQL databases.

Compared to the trade-offs demanded by these two alternatives (relational vs. NoSQL), TimescaleDB offers the best of
both worlds for time-series data:

#### Easy to use

Full SQL interface for all SQL natively supported by PostgreSQL (including secondary indexes, non-time based
aggregates, sub-queries, JOINs, window functions).

* Connects to any client or tool that speaks PostgreSQL, no changes needed.
* Time-oriented features, API functions, and optimizations.
* Robust support for data retention policies.

## Installing on HassOS

Installing TimescaleDB on HassOS is made very simple by the Home Assistant add-on store.

Before you can install the add-on you need to add the correct add-on repository first:
You can do this by navigating to the "Add-ons" section of your Home Assistant settings. Press the "Add-on store" button in the bottom right.
Then, using the menu at the top right navigate to "Repositories." Here, you need to add this repo: `https://github.com/Expaso/hassos-addons`

After this is done, you can install the TimescaleDB and pgAdmin add-ons from the add-on store.

For further installation and configuration options, please refer to the install guide [here](https://github.com/Expaso/hassos-addon-timescaledb#home-assistant-add-on-store).

## Changing password

By default, the TimescaleDB add-on creates a default user on the database with the password `homeassistant`. This is not secure
by any means and needs to be changed.

To change the password first open the WebUI of the pgAdmin extentsion. Now in the left-hand navigation bar, right-click on *'Servers'* and
go to *'Register'->'Server'*. Fill in a name of your choice, I chose `TimescaleDB`. Then under the *'Connection'* tab, fill in the following
hostname: `77b2833f-timescaledb`, and for the password, enter `homeassistant`. The server can now be managed from within pgAdmin.

Now expand the server you just added by clicking on the arrow next to its name. Now right click the server and go to *'Query Tool'*.
Here, we can actually change the password. Paste in the following query: `ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'strongpassword';` replace
this with your password of choice. Then press *'Execute script'*.

The last step will be right-clicking on the server and selecting *'Delete'*. When this is done, you can re-add the server just like above,
only this time using your newly created password.

## Exposing PostgreSQL port

In order for us to connect to the PostgreSQL database from outside the Home Assistant host we need to expose its port.

To do this we navigate to the *'Configuration'* tab on the add-on's page. Then under *'Network'* toggle *'Show disabled ports'* on.
Now in the field that appears enter `5432` (or any other port of your choise).

That's it, we can now access the database server from outside of Home Assistant.

## Sending Home Assistant data to TimescaleDB

:::note
I am assuming here that you already have HACS installed, if not, please refer to these [docs](https://hacs.xyz/docs/user/).
:::

To get Home Assistant data into TimescaleDB we need to use a custom integration called LTSS (Long time state storage).
This integration can easily be installed through HACS and can be found under the name `ltss`.

Once LTSS has been installed we can configure it through our `configuration.yaml` file. First we need to add the URL of our
new database as a secret. So in `secrets.yaml` add the following line, replacing `***` with your password:

```yaml
postgres_url: postgresql://postgres:***@77b2833f-timescaledb:5432/homeassistant
```

After that, we can add the following to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
ltss:
  db_url: !secret postgres_url
  include:
    domains:
      - sensor
```

You can see that in this config it will only include entities within the `sensor` domain. You can tweak this setting to include
other domains or entities. For more config options, see [here](https://github.com/freol35241/ltss#configuration).

The only thing left to do is restart Home Assistant and LTSS will start shipping data to your TimescaleDB! :tada:

## Viewing data in pgAdmin

Now we can use pgAdmin to view the data that is being shipped to the database. To do this, open up pgAdmin and make sure
that you are connected to the TimescaleDB server. You can now right-click on the database named `homeassistant` and select
the *'Query Tool'*. Execute the following query to view the data:

```sql
SELECT * from ltss
```

You will now be presented with the shipped data. You can see that there are columns for `time`, `entity_id`, `state`, and `attributes`. 
On the bottom of the page, you can see how many entries there are in this database table.
You can query for a specific entity with the following query, replacing it with the entity-id of your choice:

```sql
SELECT * from ltss WHERE entity_id='sensor.temperature'
```
