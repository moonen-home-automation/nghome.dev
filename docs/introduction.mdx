# Introduction

A while back something got me thinking: 

> ***What are the next steps for a smart home?***

Everyone has something of a smart home appliance in their homes these days.
Be it a smart TV, Sonos sound system, smart lights, smart plug, or something else of this nature.
Most of the time these devices do not integrate well with each other,
needing people to install a plethora of apps on their phones to control all these devices.

The next step would be to integrate these devices into a common platform,
making it easier for them to communicate with each other.
Giving the user the ability to create complex automations
and have a single app on their phone for controlling all their devices.
This is what I think makes a home truly smart: being able to control and automate every aspect of the home.
These platforms are becoming very readily available with standards like Matter
or DIY solutions like Home Assistant.

But what is next? What comes after the *smart* home? An... intelligent home?

Intelligence is not an easy thing to comprehend. What makes something or someone truely intelligent?
What are the aspects of an intelligence? These are all difficult questions that are yet to be clearly answered.
Yet we can create an abstract definition of what we think intelligence looks like for the smart home.
To create an *intelligent* home.

I'm going to be taking you all along with me in my journey of figuring out this next big step.
So come along!
